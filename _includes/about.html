									Hello friends! My name is Laura Beth. I've lived in Nashville now for almost 5 years. I love great food and I love sharing greatness with others!
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									I'm a Leo as zodiac signs go. I'm light hearted, calm, hardworking, loyal, passionate, and independent. I seek balance in all things and am always looking to evolve and better my life experience.
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									Ladder &amp; Dolly is the result of many years of brainstorming but primarily came to me during the postpartum recovery of my first son, in January 2014. I had a beautifully supportive and overwhelmingly gracious support team that hardly left my side,
									making sure I had water, organic snacks and healthy, well-rounded meals 24-7. This was an extremely beneficial way for me to gain back my strength and begin the incredible journey into motherhood. I am forever grateful to them for loving me this
									way. That said, it was a lot of work keeping foods prepared and at the ready!
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									This all sparked desire and inspiration within me to create a business where my focus is to enhance others' lives by providing service that ensures quality and convenience to each individual's needs and lifestyle.
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									Whether you are a new mother, a small family that's on the go, or you're just looking for help with meal planning and execution to support your already healthy and robust lifestyle, I can help!
								</p>
								<p></p>

									About The Name

						</div>
						<div id="about_name" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="heading_name">
							<div class="panel-body">
								<p></p>
								<p>
									"What's it all about?"
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									"What does the name mean?"
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									"Where did the name come from?"
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									The two words jumped off the screen at me one day in an email to the maintenance man of my apartment complex.
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									"... could you please leave me the ladder and dolly outside unit #369?"
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									The words not only rolled out of my mouth nicely as I read aloud, they also made me feel something. A ladder and a dolly ... as pieces of metal and rubber, expertly fashioned to be the tools that they are, they would soon be helping me set up a new home.
									Helping me with some of the heavy lifting, the hanging of curtains at the tippie top of 18 foot ceilings and providing me the ability to playfully move things about my space until it all felt just right.
								</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									Symbolically, I feel as though the name represents my passion in life. To help others obtain success and inspiration in their lives by sharing my own high standards for nutrition, health, and overall well being. To create more time, space, and ease for
									you and your family by preparing great quality foods and balanced meals that can be enjoyed together around a dining room table or on the go as you sprint out the door to work. To hopefully inspire and become inspired by those around me daily
									so that we're all feeling more and more playful about our time here together.
								</p>

									<li><i class="fa fa-li fa-cutlery"></i>
										I welcome the opportunity to meet with you for a free one hour consultation where we can discuss your nutrition goals and desires so taht your menu is suitable to you and your family's needs. It would also be an opportunity for me to familiarize
										myself with any food allergies or special dietary concerns you may have. (I'm happy to communicate with you about these things via email or over the phone as well).
									</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-li fa-cutlery"></i>
										I will do the grocery shopping for ingredients needed in order to prepare your pre-approved menu.
									</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-li fa-cutlery"></i>
										Groceries purchased are always all organic as well as local and seasonal whenever available.
										<ul>
											<li>The cost of the groceries will be added to your total service charge of $250 and will be paid for directly by the client.</li>
											<li>A copy of the grocery receipt will be yours to review and keep as well.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-li fa-cutlery"></i>
										We schedule a "cook day"!  I will come and cook in your kitchen on a day and time that is convenient for you and your family to have me in your kitchen for at least 3 hours.
									</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-li fa-cutlery"></i>
										I will bring some of my own cooking utensils, a cooking essentials kit of my own including organic oils and organic spices, knives, and any other specialty equipment that I may need in order to prepare your approved menu.

									<li><i class="fa fa-li fa-cutlery"></i>
										I will provide complete preparation, portioning, and packaging for the freezer <i>in glass or tupperware containers that are provided by you.</i>
										<ul>
											<li>
												I personally recommend and prefer the 10 piece Pyrex Glass storage set with blue lids. You can purchase them in most stores or on <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> for around $16-20. I recommend getting two sets if you're starting with little to no food storage already.
											</li>
											<li>
												I am happy to purchase these for you and just add the cost to your grocery bill upon request.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><i class="fa fa-li fa-cutlery"></i>
										I will provide a quick recap of the prepared dish and reheating instructions for all foods.
