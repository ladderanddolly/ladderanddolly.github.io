					Hello friends! My name is Laura Beth. I've lived in Nashville now for almost 5
					years. I love great food and I love sharing greatness with others!
				</p>
                <br>
				<p>
					I'm a Leo as zodiac signs go. I'm light hearted, calm, hardworking, loyal,
					passionate, and independent. I seek balance in all things and am always looking
					to evolve and better my life experience.

					Ladder &amp; Dolly is the result of many years of brainstorming but primarily
					came to me during the postpartum recovery of my first son, in January 2014. I
					had a beautifully supportive and overwhelmingly gracious support team that
					hardly left my side, making sure I had water, organic snacks and healthy,
					well-rounded meals 24-7. This was an extremely beneficial way for me to gain
					back my strength and begin the incredible journey into motherhood. I am forever
					grateful to them for loving me this way. That said, it was a lot of work keeping
					foods prepared and at the ready!
				</p>
                <br>
				<p>
					This all sparked desire and inspiration within me to create a business where my
					focus is to enhance others' lives by providing service that ensures quality and
					convenience to each individual's needs and lifestyle.
				</p>
                <br>
				<p>
					Whether you are a new mother, a small family that's on the go, or you're just
					looking for help with meal planning and execution to support your already
					healthy and robust lifestyle, I can help!
